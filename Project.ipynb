    "# Clustering Network Traffic for Cybersecurity Analysis Using CICIDS2017 Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## [LINK TO GITHUB REPOSITORY](https://github.com/Karan-D-Software/Machine-Learning-Network-Security)\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to perform clustering analysis on the CICIDS2017 dataset to identify patterns and group similar types of network traffic. The objective is to detect and categorize different types of network activities, which can help in identifying normal and potentially malicious behaviors. Through this analysis, we hope to gain insights into the characteristics of various network traffic clusters and enhance our understanding of cybersecurity threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "We use the CICIDS2017 dataset, which includes various types of network traffic, such as normal traffic, DoS, DDoS, and other types of attacks. The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle.\n",
